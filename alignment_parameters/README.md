The outfmt6 files were converted into CSV format, including a header line for column identification, and additional metrics were computed for each alignment, namely coverage and length ratio (converte_to_csv.py). 
Then, the CSV files with all relevant parameters were graphically analysed (alignment_analysis.ipynb).
