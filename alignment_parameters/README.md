The outfmt6 files were converted to CSV format, including a header line for column identification, and additional metrics were computed for each alignment, namely coverage and length ratio (converte_to_csv.py). The resulting CSV files containing all relevant parameters were then graphically analyzed (alignment_analysis.ipynb).
