To align the local database against the corresponding reference sequences, first convert the reference FASTA files into DIAMOND database format using makedb.sh, and then run the alignments with alignments.sh.
The notebook aligned_sequences_retrieval.ipynb can be used to retrieve the aligned FASTA sequences from the outfmt6 output files and the original FASTA inputs.
