# According to the BV-BRC CLI's documentation (https://www.bv-brc.org/docs/cli_tutorial/index.html)


# First, you'll need to extract the gene IDs from each genome:

p3-echo 'product_name' | p3-find-features product > gene_ids.txt
# Replace product_name with the product name of interest, and gene with the desired name for the file where the IDs will be saved


# Then extract the sequences for the IDs with p3-get-feature-sequence: 

p3-get-feature-sequence --input gene_ids.txt --col 2 > gene.fasta
# Replace gene_ids.txt with the folder name that contains the ID list, and gene with the desired name for the file where the sequences will be saved
